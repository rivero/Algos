	215. Kth Largest Element in an Array
	Given an integer array nums and an integer k, return the kth largest element in the array.

	Note that it is the kth largest element in the sorted order, not the kth distinct element.

	Can you solve it without sorting?



	Example 1:
	Input: nums = [3,2,1,5,6,4], k = 2
	Output: 5

	Example 2:
	Input: nums = [3,2,3,1,2,4,5,5,6], k = 4
	Output: 4

	Input = [6, 8, 7, 5, 9, 4, 2, 3] k = 6
	Output = 4

	Constraints:

	1 <= k <= nums.length <= 10^5
	-10^4 <= nums[i] <= 10^4

	Approach 2/3: Min-Heap
	The main idea of this solution is to use a min-heap with a maximum size of k. By doing this, we ensure that the 
	smallest of the k largest elements is always on the top of the heap.

	Key Data Structures:
	heap:
	This is a min-heap containing the first k elements of nums. As we progress, we will modify this heap to ensure it 
	contains the k largest elements.

	Step-by-step Breakdown:

	Initialization:
	Create a heap with the first k elements of nums.
	Transform this list into a min-heap.
	Iterate through the List:

	For each of the remaining elements in nums:
	If the element is larger than the smallest element in the heap (i.e., the top of the heap):
	Remove the top element from the heap.
	Insert the current element into the heap.
	Result:

	After processing all elements in nums, the top of the heap will contain the kth largest element. Return this element.
	Example:
	Consider the list nums = [3,2,1,5,6,4] with k = 2.

	Here's the evolution of the heap:

	Initial State:

	       [Element, ...,   TOP] <-because it ios a min-heap it keeps the smallest at the top

	heap: [2, 3]
	After processing index 2 (element = 1):
	heap remains unchanged as 1 is not larger than 2 (top).
	
	After processing index 3 (element = 5):
	heap: [3,5]

	After processing index 4 (element = 6):
	heap: [5,6]

	After processing index 5 (element = 4):
	heap: [5,6]

	The final state of the heap shows that the top of the min-heap is the kth largest element is 5.

	Complexity
	Time Complexity: O(nlogk)
	Each of the n elements is processed once. However, heap operations take O(logk) time, leading to an overall 
	complexity of O(nlogk).

	Space Complexity: O(k)
	The solution uses a heap with a maximum of k elements.

	Performance
	This solution is both time and space-efficient. By focusing only on the k largest elements and using the 
	properties of a heap, it ensures optimal runtime for a wide range of inputs. The controlled space usage 
	ensures that even for large k, the memory overhead remains minimal.

	My explanation

	Initialize min-heap with the first k values. The heap will have the smallest value at the top because the 
	heap is set to be a min-heap.

	from i = k compare nums[i] with the heap's min (top)  value.
	if nums[i] is larger, remove the top value in the heap and push nums[i]
	Continue comparing. 

	Since the min-heap sorts from smallest to biggest, the top value will be the kth largest.
